# ðŸ“Š **AnalyticsManager SDK for Android**

`AnalyticsManager` is a simple and lightweight analytics SDK designed for Native Android (Kotlin) applications. This SDK enables developers to seamlessly track user sessions, custom events, and screen time. The SDK also ensures that session data persists even when the app is restarted, thanks to `SharedPreferences` integration.
